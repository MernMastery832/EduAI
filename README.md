## About The Project
This project is a full-stack web application developed as a final graduation project with the objective of creating a fully functional Learning Management System (LMS) integrated with various machine learning models. The LMS incorporates both standard and innovative AI-enhanced features to optimize learning and teaching experiences. 

This repository includes the front-end and back-end components but does not include the machine learning models.
